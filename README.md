What It Does:

ðŸŒ¾ Direct Farmer-to-User Connection:

Eliminates Middlemen: Farmers sell directly to consumers, cutting out intermediaries and reducing costs.
Cost Efficiency: Engineered to save money for both farmers and consumers.

ðŸ“Š Real-time Data Management:
Uses MongoDB for instant storage and retrieval of data, ensuring up-to-date information.


ðŸ“ˆ High Commitment Rates:
Achieved a 71% commitment rate from farmers and an 84% commitment rate from users.
Key Features:

Flexible Ordering: Customers can place orders until midnight the day before delivery, ensuring that farmers only bring the required quantity.
Dynamic Management: Farmers can update product availability and delivery times to match demand.
Order Tracking: Includes order tracing features so customers can track their orders in real-time.
How It Works:

Farmer Listings: Farmers list their available products and adjust quantities and delivery times as needed.
Direct Delivery: Products are delivered directly from farmers to customers within one day, reducing traditional supply chain delays and costs.
Order Placement: Customers place orders up until midnight before delivery, ensuring accurate and efficient delivery.
Milk Delivery: The platform also features a milk delivery service, adding more convenience.
Why It Matters:
This platform streamlines the food supply chain by removing traditional intermediaries, reducing costs, and ensuring fresher produce. Farmers have greater control over their sales, and consumers enjoy timely deliveries and real-time order tracking.

Iâ€™m excited about the potential of this project to enhance the efficiency of food distribution and benefit both farmers and consumers. Feel free to reach out if you want to learn more about this innovative solution!
